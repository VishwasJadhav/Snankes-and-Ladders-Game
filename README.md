# 🐍🎲 Snakes & Ladders – Python Console Game

A beginner-friendly Python implementation of the classic **Snakes & Ladders** game.  
This repository documents my **learning progression**, starting from a basic single-player version and extending to a structured multiplayer game.

---

## 📌 About the Project

This project was built to practice **core Python fundamentals** and gradually improve code structure and game logic.

The repository contains **two versions** of the game:
1. A **single-player version** (learning stage)
2. A **multiplayer version** (improved logic and structure)

---

## 🧪 Version 1: Single-Player Game (Beginner Level)

**Purpose:** Learning Python basics

This version represents my **initial stage of learning Python**.  
It is a simple console-based Snakes & Ladders game for one player.

### Features
- Single-player gameplay
- Dice roll simulation
- Snakes and ladders using dictionaries
- Win condition at position 100
- Exit option during gameplay

### Concepts Used
- `while` loops
- Conditional statements
- Dictionaries
- User input handling
- Random number generation using NumPy

## 🎮 Version 2: Multiplayer Game (Improved Version)

**Purpose:** Applying better structure and scalability

This version improves the game by supporting **multiple players** and cleaner logic.

### New Features
- Multiple players support
- Player name input
- Turn-by-turn rotation
- Player exit handling during the game
- Improved validation and flow

### Concepts Used
- Lists of dictionaries for player state
- Input validation
- Modulo-based turn rotation
- Better separation of game logic

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Translating real-world game rules into code
- Managing game state across multiple players
- Writing cleaner and more readable Python logic
- Improving beginner code step by step

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy (for dice rolling)

---

## 🚀 Possible Future Improvements
- Use Python’s built-in `random` module instead of NumPy
- Add a visual board representation
- Add replay option
- Convert the game into an Object-Oriented (OOP) version

## 🏁 Note
This project is **learning-focused**, showing progression rather than perfection.  
Suggestions and feedback are welcome.
