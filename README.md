# Snakes-and-Ladders-Game

### About This Project

This repository contains **two versions** of a Snakes & Ladders game built in Python.
The project documents my learning journey, starting from a basic single-player game and progressing to a structured multiplayer version.

#### The focus is on:
- Unerstanding loops and Conditionals.
- Using dictonaris for game rules.
- Handling user input.
- Managing game state logically.

## Version 1: Single Player Game
**Purpose:** Learning core Python fundamentals
This version represents my initial learning stage in Python.
It is a simple console-based Snakes & Ladders game with one player.

#### Concepts Practiced:
- while loops
- Conditional statements
- Dictionaries (snakes, ladders)
- Random number generation using NumPy
- Basic input handling

#### Highlights:
- Single player gameplay
- Dice roll simulation
- Snake & ladder movement logic
- Win condition at position 100

## Version 2: Multiplayer Game
**Purpose:** Applying structure, validation, and scalability

This version extends the first game into a **multiplayer console game** with better structure and validation.

#### New Features:
- Multiple players support
- Player name input
- Turn-by-turn rotation
- Dynamic player removal on exit
- Improved game flow and readability

#### Concepts Practiced:
- Lists of dictionaries for player state
- Modulo logic for turn rotation
- 










Lists of dictionaries for player state


Input validation

Cleaner separation of game logic
